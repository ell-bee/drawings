### Sketch 1 Reflection

I had trouble figuring out the ratios of my x and y coordinates to get the exact placement that I wanted; I had to tinker around with it until I got it to look how I wanted it to. They weren't the ratios that I used in my initial sketch, meaning I clearly didn't understand how the ratios work yet, but the tinkering that I did gave me a better idea of how to use them. Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with how my drawing came out, because I really wasn't understanding the code I was supposed to be using when I first starded out, but I figured it out as I went along.
