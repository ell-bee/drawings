### Sketch 2 Reflection

I didn't really understand what the different types of variables meant, so I had a hard time understanding that. But since I asked Mr. Oswald for help, I understood what the variables were supposed to be, and how to use them. I'm proud of the attempt that I made, using variables that I hadn't used before like mouseX and mouseY, and creating two of my own functions.
